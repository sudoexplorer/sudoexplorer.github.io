Cybertruck is amazing, period. Just like the one line description of the vehicle says it is "Better utility vehicle than a truck with more performance than a sports car"

The Cybertruck is a polarizing truck. The one thing that makes it polarizing is it's Bladerunnerish, out-of-the movie style design. It also has these headlights like from the movie TRON.
Some people in the meme world compares the angles design of the truck to the PS1 version of Lara croft from Tomb raider, pretty sharp eh!

The Key-Specs:
1. It's all electric.
2. Made in a Ultra hard 30x Cold-Rolled stainless steel structure that Elon says which is used in starship too. 
3. Tesla armor glass which is an ultra-strong glass and polymer layered composite. 
4. Comes in 3 variants - Single motor RWD, Dual and Tri motor version. Each of these variants comes with different performance level with the latter reaching 60kmph in less than 2.9 seconds.
5. Can pull a Ford F-150 on it's full power.

Mileage:
Something that everyone doubts or looks forward in an all electric car.
Cybertruck will give you 250+ miles approx in the $39,900 Single motor variant, 300+ miles in the $49,900 Double motor variant and approx 500+ miles in the high end Three motor variant.

Speed to reach 60mph from 0:

You can book your Tesla Cybertruck by pre-ordering for just $100 which is also fully refundable. 

As of today, Elon musk has claimed that Tesla has received over 200,000 orders for the Cybertruck.

Funny accident: 
On the launch event when Lead designer Franz von Holzhausen demonstrated the Armored glass of Cybertruck it nearly smashed the living soul out of it. It broke the window but didn't go through. 

Elon said in a tweet later that they had already tested the Armor glass on the launch vehicle before the event with Metal ball and on stage they used a Sledgehammer to show how strong the exoskeleton is. This might've caused micro fractures in the glass which later broke when they threw a metal ball on it.

Here's them throwing the metal ball before the launch event:

Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha. <a href="https://t.co/eB0o4tlPoz">pic.twitter.com/eB0o4tlPoz</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198090787520598016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>

Verdict:

Overall Tesla's Cybertrck is an amazing all electric Truck which we've all been waiting for. It's a good thing we have people like Elon that makes finction into reality. If you want a badass pickup truck that can be more than a pickup truck and also save the planet by going all electric, don't wait and go buy one.
