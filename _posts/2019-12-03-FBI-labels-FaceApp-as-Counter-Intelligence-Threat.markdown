In a letter issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a reply to the US Senerator, Charles R Schumer hav designated the mobile application FaceApp as a Counter Intelligence threat.

The letter is a follow up response after the Senator have requested the FBI and the Federal Trade Commision(FTC) to look into the FaceApp application dated on July 17th of 2019.

FBI have mentioned the reason for labelling it as a Counter Intelligence threat as follows:

"The language of FaceApp's terms of service and end user license agreement describes the mechanisms FaceApp uses for access to a device's analytics information, cookies, log files information, device identifiers, and metadata, and to any user content and communications made directly between the user and FaceApp.
Social media providers generally use such mechanisms to obtain consent from users. Specific to FaceApp, however, is the submissio of a user's photo for manipulation, which FaceApp uploads to cloud servers hosted(according to FaceApp) in the United States, Singapore, Ireland and Australia. FaceApp has publicly claied that it removes most photos from its servers 48 hours after submission.

The FBI considers any mobile application or similar product developed in Russia, such as FaceApp, to be a potential counterintelligence threat, based on the data the product collects, it's privacy and terms of use policies, and the legal mechanisms available to the Government of Russia that permit access to data with Russia's borders. Russia's intelligece services maintain robust cyber exploitation capabilities are evidenced by, for example, Russia's surveillance system, the System of Operative Search Measures which allows Russian Federal Security Service (FBS) to obtain telephonic and online communications via direct connection to Internet service providers(ISP).
In other words, the FSB can remotely access all communications and servers on Russian networks without making a request to ISPs.

If the FBI assesses that elected officials, candidates, political campaigns, or political partics are targets of foriegn influence operations involving FaceApp, the FBI would coordinate notifications, investigate, and engage the Foriegn Influence Task Force as appropriate. 
The FBI's Protected Voices webpage on FBI.gov provides publically accessible videos on the most urgent cybersecurity issues that may leave an election campaign's computer network vulnerable to attack."

The official letter was posted by Jill C, Tyson who is the Assistant Director of the Office of Congressial Affairs.
